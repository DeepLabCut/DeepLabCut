Then, we cast the matching between models’ predictions (2D coordinates)\n",

Thus for every image, we end up getting a matching matrix where 1 counts formatch and 0 counts for non-matching. Because the models’ predictions can be noisy from image to image, we average the aforementioned matching matrix across all the images and perform another bipartite matching, resulting in the final keypoint conversion table between the model and the dataset. Note that the quality of thematching will impact the performance\n",
