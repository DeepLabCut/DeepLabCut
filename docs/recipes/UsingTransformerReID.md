# Using DeepLabCut to track animals with TransformerReID

Sometimes animals cannot be distinguished by a human annotator, but having the animal ID is still desirable. DeepLabCut now supports a Transformer architecture which is trained in an unsupervised setting for tracking animals and inferring ID.

Our approach uses condensed feature information (embeddings) from predicted short-but-robust trackers, which are used as a training dataset of our unsupervised re-identification method to distinguish individuals based on their appearance. For more details on the method, see [Lauer et. al 2022](TODO:AddLinkHere!).

## Code Example
A minimal code example illustrating how to use this tracking-reID method is shown below. This assumes that there is already a multi-animal project created, and frames are extracted and labeled. For more information on how to do these, see the [main multi-animal guide](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/maDLC_UserGuide.html).

```python

import deeplabcut

config = "/home/mammoth/dlc-project/config.yaml"

deeplabcut.train_network(config)

videos_to_analyze = ["/home/mammoth/files/video1.mp4"]

# It is important to set autotrack=False, as this will use the
# normal tracking method by default
deeplabcut.analyze_videos(
    config, videos_to_analyze, videotype="mp4", auto_track=False
)

# Convert the detections to tracklets
deeplabcut.convert_detections2tracklets(
    config, videos_to_analyze, videotype="mp4"
)

# Use the transformer network to track and reID animals
deeplabcut.transformer_reID(
    config, videos_to_analyze, videotype="mp4"
)

# Create a video with the tracked data
deeplabcut.create_labeled_video(
    config, videos_to_analyze, videotype="mp4"
```

## Intuition on the Transformer parameters

The function signature is as follows:

```python
def transformer_reID(
    path_config_file,
    videos,
    n_tracks=None,
    train_frac = 0.8, 
    trainingsetindex=0, 
    modelprefix="",
    track_method="ellipse",
    train_epochs=100,
    n_triplets=1000,
    shuffle=1,
)
```

While some arguments are similar to the rest of the DeepLabCut API, `train_epochs` and `n_triplets` are specific to `transformer_reID()`. 

The default values were found to work good in [our paper]((TODO:AddLinkHere!)), however this heavily depends on having good detections and assemblies beforehand. You should run `deeplabcut.create_video_with_all_detections()` and inspect that the detection performance is sufficient. To inspect the quality of assembled animals you can use `deeplabcut.plot_edge_affinity_distributions()`.

If you find that the detection and assembly performance in a video are sufficient, but the `transformer_reID()` results in poor tracking, you can consider increasing the number of training epochs for the transformer, or the number of triplets (which you can think of as the dataset size that the transformer is training on).
