    "Read the [DeepLabCut Blog post](https://deeplabcut.medium.com/balancing-bats-d3c5bcfb71e1) about how one can solve unbalanced data with flipping-keypoint augmentation, then see below for the process and code to do so!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The dataset\n",
    "This dataset consists of videos of bats flying freely at the [Austin Bat Refuge](https://austinbatrefuge.org/). The videos were shot by Dr. Aaron Corcoran, Head of the [Sensory & Aerial Ecology lab](https://sonarjamming.com/) at the University of Colorado, Colorado Sprungs (UCCS) in 2020. The dataset is comprised of 26 video triplets. Each triplet consists of three videos depicting the same bat flight from different angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The videos have been partially digitized in [DLTdv](https://github.com/tlhedrick/dltdv) after which custom MATLAB code has been used to extract the digitized frames and coordinates in a format that DeepLabCut can read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "This text documents my experience in using data augmentation to improve the accuracy of DeepLabCut in tracking bodyparts of the bats in the videos during my time as a [DeepLabCut AI Resident](https://www.deeplabcutairesidency.org/) during the summer of 2022."

    "## Structuring the project for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Since bats are such a challenging animal to automatcially digitize, in my lab, we've been relying on what I call \"refining\" to improve DLC accuracy. This just means that for each video that we want to analyze, we first digitize a few frames from it and include those frames as training data for the DeepLabCut network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically digitize approximately one frame per wingbeat. For a wingbeat frequency of 15 and a framerate of 800, this means approximately every 50th frame. For a lower framerate, say 400, we instead need to digitize every 50th frame. This is obviously less labour than digitizing every frame, but the workflow still scales poorly with increased acquisition. Therefore, I want to reduce the required amount of manual digitization. The challenge I've set myself is therefore this - **to use augmentation to match or beat the accuracy of refining**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test data\n",
    "I randomly chose seven digitized triplets of videos for testing. Every 50th frame of these will be used for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Treatments\n",
    "I will use two \"treatments\" for testing. Firstly, I simply test how increasing the amount of training data affects accuracy. Secondly, I test how adding refining data affects accuracy. The result is a four permutations of treatments in total, sorted into four shuffles as shown in *table 1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Refining\n",
    "The seven testing video triplets have had every 25th frame digitized. Frames 50, 100, 150, ... is used for testing. In this treatment, frames 25, 75, 175, ... will be used for used as training data, i.e. refining. I call the networks not trained on refining data OOD for out of domain and the ones traioned on refining data Ref for refining.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Amount of base training data\n",
    "Subtracting the seven testing video triplets, I'm left with 19 (57 videos in total). I then randomly split these into two groups of 9 and 10. I will either train on only 10 of these video triplets, or on all 19. I call these treatments \"half\" and \"full\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This treatment might not seem relevant for figuring out how augmentation affects performance, and in truth, I chose to perform this test to answer another question, but you will see that the results of this test are very relevant to the challenge written in bold above.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will refer to training data from the 19 videos not tested on as \"base training data\".\n",

More on this later, but for now, we need to create a dummy training dataset as this will make DeepLabCut create a nice list of all the frames in the dataset."

    "## Using modelprefixes to keep track of augmentations\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are using the shuffles to keep track of the training data used for our different networks, but we will also be trying different augmentatns. So how do we keep track of that? We could just keep making new shuffles and keep a list of what shuffle is what, but that can quickly become unwieldy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can use modelprefixes. They provide a way to structure a DLC project into something like subprojects. Basically, if you copy a dlc-model folder (in my case, found in ```/home/user/projects/bat_augmentation_austin_2020_bat_data-DLC-2022-08-18/dlc-models/iteration-0```) into a subfolder in the project, you can then interact with the copied dlc model by using the argument ```modelprefix```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say, for example, that I want to try a more aggressive motion blur augmentation, then I could create a folder called ```extra_blurry``` in my project, copy the dlc-models into it, and then change the pose_cfg.yaml files that contain the augmentation parameters to increase the motion blur augmentation.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first networks will be trained with the default augmentation, but it's still useful to create a folder for them as we will want to copy the dlc-models in the root project folder for later augmentations, so it makes sense to keep those clean and do all training with model prefixes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regarding trainingsetindex\n",
    "Before we can create our subfolders, we need to spend a minute on the trainingset indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often use different splits between training and testing data. This is a number < 1 that sets the proportion of the training dataset that should be used for training and testing. The default is 0.95, meaning 95% is used for training, and 5% for testing. This can be either be specified in the config.yaml file or deduced automatically by DeepLabCut if we manually specify the training and testing indices (like we did). In the case of the latter, the split is indicated by the filenames of the the files in the training-dataset folder in the project folder. In my case this would be:\n",

The second thing is that there are instances where \"half, ref\" does better than \"full, ref\" and vice versa, which could explain why they are significantly different according to the statistical test performed above, despite their overall means being relatively similar according to the plot of the mean errors on the full error distributions.\n",

To get an idea of if the videos on which the network does well differs from the one on which it does poorly, we can create labeled frames with the predicted positions of the bodyparts and the correct positions (human labels). This is done with the ```evaluate_network``` function using the ```plotting``` input parameter."

    "There is another augmentation that, in our case, is related to the flight direction, namely the rotation augmentation. The idea here is that in order to prevent the network from associating absolute in-image spatial orientation with positions for certain labels, we want to randomly rotate some of the training data. The degree to which this makes sense is context dependent. If you are analyzing a horse walking in a horizontal direction from the camera's point of view, large degrees of rotation make little sense as the network will never encounter a horse walking upside down. But if you are filming an animal from above, or below if the animal is flying or swimming, such that the animal is free to move in any direction, then this type of augmentation makes sense.\n",

    "The results look very promising. Video 1 keeps being difficult. This is likely due to this video depicting a bat flying in a manner that is atypical for the dataset used here. Most videos in the dataset depict rather straight-forward flybys, but video 1 shows a bat slowly ascending while turning. Even so, the augmentation has lowered the pixel error for video 1 compared to the baseline, and for all other videos, the augmentation has led to performance close to, or better than, the refined case.\n",

    "## Where scalability is not important, consider refining\n",
    "We saw from our baseline accuracy tests that when refining, there was no gain from increasing the amount of base training data. In practical terms this means that if you know which videos you want to analyze, and when you do not plan on using the network for analyzing other videos in the future, then it makes sense to prioritize digitizing frames from the videos to be analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inspect bodypart predictions and augment with purpose\n",
    "At first, I tried a couple of permutations of different image augmentations and saw no or little performance improvement. I tried augmentations related to scale, brightness, blurriness, and probably some other that slip my mind at the moment. I more or less concluded that augmentations have little effect and that for a given set of training and test data, DeepLabCut's default training parameters are close to optimal and little can be gained by augmenting the training data. But then I looked closer at the labeled frames from ```evaluate_network``` and realized that the high pixel errors were mainly caused by the network getting left and right mixed up and augmented accordingly. Doing that, I saw an average accuracy improvement of more than 10 pixels. For this dataset, 10 pixels is quite big, for comparison, on the largest image in the test dataset, the forearm of the bat is less than 70 pixels long.\n",
