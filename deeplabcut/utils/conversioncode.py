def convertcsv2h5(config, userfeedback=True, scorer=None):
    """
    Convert (image) annotation files in folder labeled-data from csv to h5.
    This function allows the user to manually edit the csv (e.g. to correct the scorer name and then convert it into hdf format).
    WARNING: conversion might corrupt the data.

    config : string
        Full path of the config.yaml file as a string.

    userfeedback: bool, optional
        If true the user will be asked specifically for each folder in labeled-data if the containing csv shall be converted to hdf format.

    scorer: string, optional
        If a string is given, then the scorer/annotator in all csv and hdf files that are changed, will be overwritten with this name.

    Examples
    --------
    Convert csv annotation files for reaching-task project into hdf.
    >>> deeplabcut.convertcsv2h5('/analysis/project/reaching-task/config.yaml')

    --------
    Convert csv annotation files for reaching-task project into hdf while changing the scorer/annotator in all annotation files to Albert!

def analyze_videos_converth5_to_csv(video_folder, videotype=".mp4"):
    """
    By default the output poses (when running analyze_videos) are stored as MultiIndex Pandas Array, which contains the name of the network, body part name, (x, y) label position \n
    in pixels, and the likelihood for each frame per body part. These arrays are stored in an efficient Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) \n
    in the same directory, where the video is stored. If the flag save_as_csv is set to True, the data is also exported as comma-separated value file. However,
    if the flag was *not* set, then this function allows the conversion of all h5 files to csv files (without having to analyze the videos again)!

    This functions converts hdf (h5) files to the comma-separated values format (.csv), which in turn can be imported in many programs, such as MATLAB, R, Prism, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------

    video_folder : string
        Absolute path of a folder containing videos and the corresponding h5 data files.

    videotype: string, optional (default=.mp4)
        Only videos with this extension are screened.

    Examples
    --------

    Converts all pose-output files belonging to mp4 videos in the folder '/media/alex/experimentaldata/cheetahvideos' to csv files.
