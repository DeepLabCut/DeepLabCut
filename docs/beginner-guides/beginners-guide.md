This guide, and related pages, are meant as a very-new-to-python beginner guide to DeepLabCut. After you are comfortable with this material we recommend then jumping into the more detailed User Guides!

- **ProTip:** For even more 'in-depth' understanding, head over to check out the [DeepLabCut Course](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/course.html), which provides a deeper dive into the science behind DeepLabCut.

## Installation

Before you begin, make sure that DeepLabCut is installed on your system.

- **ProTip:** For detailed installation instructions, geared towards a bit more advanced users, refer to the [Full Installation Guide](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/installation.html).

## Beginner User Guide
If you are new to Python, the best way to get Python installed onto your computer is with Anaconda. [Head over here and download the version that is best for your computer](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

- "Conda", as it's often called, it a very nice way to create "environments (env)" on your computer. While there can be some cross-talk, in general, it allows you to separate the different tools you need to use to get your science done 💪. 

## Let's learn a bit and create a DeeplabCut env:

After you have installed Anaconda, open the new program (Anaconda Terminal). You will be in your "root" directory by default. 

**(0) Create a fresh `conda environment`** 

In the terminal, type:

```
conda create -n deeplabcut python=3.10
```
You will be prompted (y/n) to install, and then wait for the magic to happen. At the end, check the terminal, it should prompt you to then type: 

```
conda activate deeplabcut
```
Now, we are going to install the core dependencies. The way this works is that there are "package managers" such as `conda` itself and python's `pip`. We are going to deploy a mix based on what we know works across ooperating systems.

**(1) Install PyTorch**

`PyTorch` is the backend deep-learning language we wrote DLC3 in. To select the right version, head to the [“Install PyTorch”](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) instructions in the official PyTorch Docs. Select your desired PyTorch build, operating system, select conda as your package manager and Python as the language. Select your compute platform (either a CUDA version or CPU only). Then, use the command to install the PyTorch package. Below are a few possible examples:

- **GPU version of pytorch for CUDA 11.8**
```
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=11.8 -c pytorch
```
- **CPU only version of pytorch, using the latest version**
```
conda install pytorch cpuonly -c pytorch
```

**(2) Install DeepLabCut** 

Alright! Next, we will install `Tables` (also called pytables), which is a package to read the HDF5 files that make up the backbone of data management in DeepLabCut, then we will install all the `deeplabcut` source code 🔥. Please decide which version you want (stable or alpha), then type: 

```
conda install -c conda-forge pytables==3.8.0
```

- **Alpha release:**
```
pip install "git+https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git@pytorch_dlc#egg=deeplabcut[gui,modelzoo,wandb]"
```
- OR run for the **Stable release:**
```
pip install "deeplabcut[gui,modelzoo,tf]"
```
- This gives you DeepLabCut, the DLC GUI (gui), our latest neural networks (modelzoo) and a cool data logger (wandb) if you choose to use it later on!

## Starting DeepLabCut

In the terminal, enter:
```bash
python -m deeplabcut
```
This will open the DeepLabCut App (note, the default is dark mode, but you can click "appearance" to change:

> 💡 **Note:** For a visual guide on navigating through the DeepLabCut GUI, check out our [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr3npnXWoD4).

## Starting a New Project

### Navigating the GUI on Initial Launch

When you first launch the GUI, you'll find three primary main options:

1. **Create New Project:** Geared towards new initiatives. A good choice if you're here to start something new.
2. **Load Project:** Use this to resume your on-hold or past work.
3. **Model Zoo:** Best suited for those who want to explore Model Zoo.

#### Commencing Your Work:

- For a first-time or new user, please click on **`Start New Project`**.

## 🐾 Steps to Start a New Project

1. **Launch New Project:**
   - When you start a new project, you'll be presented with an empty project window. In DLC3+ you will see a new option "Engine".
   - We recommend using the PyTorch Engine:

2. **Filling in Project Details:**
   - **Naming Your Project:**
     - Give a specific, well-defined name to your project.
      
      > **💡 Tip:** Avoid empty spaces in your project name.

   - **Naming the Experimenter:**
     - Fill in the name of the experimenter. This part of the data remains immutable.

3. **Determine Project Location:** 
   - By default, your project will be located on the **Desktop**.
   - To pick a different home, modify the path as needed.

4. **Multi-Animal or Single-Animal Project:**
   - Tick the 'Multi-Animal' option in the menu, but only if that's the mode of the project.
   - Choose the 'Number of Cameras' as per your experiment.

5. **Adding Videos:**
   - First, click on **`Browse Videos`** button on the right side of the window, to search for the video contents.
   - Once the media selection tool opens, navigate and select the folder with your videos.
     
     > **💡 Tip:** DeepLabCut supports **`.mp4`**, **`.avi`**, **`.mkv`** and **`.mov`** files.
   - A list will be created with all the videos inside this folder.
   - Unselect the videos you wish to remove from the project.
     
6. **Create your project:**
   - Click on **`Create`** button on the bottom, right side of the main window.
   - A new folder named after your project's name will be created in the location you chose above.
