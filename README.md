# Welcome! 👋

**DeepLabCut™️** is a toolbox for state-of-the-art markerless pose estimation of animals performing various behaviors. As long as you can see (label) what you want to track, you can use this toolbox, as it is animal and object agnostic. [Read a short development and application summary below](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut#why-use-deeplabcut). 

# [Installation: how to install DeepLabCut](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/installation.html)

Please click the link above for all the information you need to get started! Please note that currently we support only Python 3.10+ (see conda files for guidance).

## Quick start

Developers Stable Release: very quick start (Python 3.10+ required) to install 
DeepLabCut with the PyTorch engine

- [1] [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (**install and then select the desired
CUDA version if you want to use a GPU**): `pip install torch torchvision`.
Or as an example for GPU support (please check pytorch docs to get the perfect version for your CUDA):
```python
# GPU version of pytorch for CUDA 11.3
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```
- [2] Then, [install `pytables`](https://www.pytables.org/usersguide/installation.html):
```python
conda install -c conda-forge pytables==3.8.0`
```
- [3] Finally, install `DeepLabCut` (with all functions + the GUI):
```python
pip install --pre  "deeplabcut[gui]"`
```
or `pip install  --pre "deeplabcut"` (headless 
version with PyTorch)!

To use the TensorFlow (TF) engine (requires Python 3.10; TF up to v2.10 supported on Windows,
up to v2.12 on other platforms): you'll need to run `pip install "deeplabcut[gui,tf]"` 
(which includes all functions plus GUIs) or `pip install "deeplabcut[tf]"` (headless
version with PyTorch and TensorFlow). We aim to depreciate the TF part in 2027.

We recommend using our conda file, see [here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/main/conda-environments/README.md) or the [`deeplabcut-docker` package](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/tree/main/docker). 

# [Documentation: The DeepLabCut Process](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/README.html)

Our docs walk you through using DeepLabCut, and key API points. For an overview of the toolbox and workflow for project management, see our step-by-step at [Nature Protocols paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-019-0176-0).

# [DEMO the code](/examples)

🐭 pose tracking of single animals demo [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/COLAB/COLAB_DEMO_mouse_openfield.ipynb)

See [more demos here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/main/examples/README.md). We provide data and several Jupyter Notebooks: one that walks you through a demo dataset to test your installation, and another Notebook to run DeepLabCut from the beginning on your own data. We also show you how to use the code in Docker, and on Google Colab.

# Why use DeepLabCut?

In 2018, we demonstrated the capabilities for [trail tracking](https://vnmurthylab.org/), [reaching in mice](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/) and various Drosophila behaviors during egg-laying (see [Mathis et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y) for details). There is, however, nothing specific that makes the toolbox only applicable to these tasks and/or species. The toolbox has already been successfully applied (by us and others) to [rats](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut), humans, various fish species, bacteria, leeches, various robots, cheetahs, [mouse whiskers](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut) and [race horses](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut). DeepLabCut utilized the feature detectors (ResNets + readout layers) of one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for human pose estimation by Insafutdinov et al., called DeeperCut, which inspired the name for our toolbox (see references below). Since this time, the package has changed substantially.  The code has been re-tooled and re-factored since 2.1+: We have added faster and higher performance variants with MobileNetV2s, EfficientNets, and our own DLCRNet backbones (see [Pretraining boosts out-of-domain robustness for pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11229) and [Lauer et al 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01443-0)). Additionally, we have improved the inference speed and provided both additional and novel augmentation methods, added real-time, and multi-animal support.
In v3.0+ we have changed the backend to support PyTorch. This brings not only an easier installation process for users, but performance gains, developer flexibility, and a lot of new tools! Importantly, the high-level API stays the same, so it will be a seamless transition for users 💜!
We currently provide state-of-the-art performance for animal pose estimation and the labs (M. Mathis Lab and A. Mathis Group) have both top journal and computer vision conference papers.

**Left:** Due to transfer learning it requires **little training data** for multiple, challenging behaviors (see [Mathis et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y) for details). **Mid Left:** The feature detectors are robust to video compression (see [Mathis/Warren](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/30/457242) for details). **Mid Right:** It allows 3D pose estimation with a single network and camera (see [Mathis/Warren](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/30/457242)). **Right:** It allows 3D pose estimation with a single network trained on data from multiple cameras together with standard triangulation methods (see [Nath* and Mathis* et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-019-0176-0)).

**DeepLabCut** is embedding in a larger open-source eco-system, providing behavioral tracking for neuroscience, ecology, medical, and technical applications. Moreover, many new tools are being actively developed. See [DLC-Utils](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DLCutils) for some helper code.

SuperAnimal models are provided for research use only (non-commercial use).

## Major Versions:

- For all versions, please see [here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/releases).

VERSION 3.0: A whole new experience with PyTorch🔥. While the high-level API remains the same, the backend and developer friendliness have greatly improved, along with performance gains!

VERSION 2.3: Model Zoo SuperAnimals, and a whole new GUI experience.

VERSION 2.2: Multi-animal pose estimation, identification, and tracking with DeepLabCut is supported (as well as single-animal projects).

VERSION 2.0-2.1: This is the **Python package** of [DeepLabCut](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y) that was originally released in Oct 2018 with our [Nature Protocols](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-019-0176-0) paper (preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/476531v1)).
This package includes graphical user interfaces to label your data, and take you from data set creation to automatic behavioral analysis. It also introduces an active learning framework to efficiently use DeepLabCut on large experimental projects, and data augmentation tools that improve network performance, especially in challenging cases (see [panel b](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/77c92f6b89d44ca758d815bdd7e801247437060b/68747470733a2f2f737461746963312e73717561726573706163652e636f6d2f7374617469632f3537663664353163396637343536366635356563663237312f742f3563336663316336373538643436393530636537656563372f313534373638323338333539352f636865657461682e706e673f666f726d61743d37353077)).
