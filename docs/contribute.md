# How to Contribute to DeepLabCut?

DeepLabCut is an actively developed package and we welcome community development and involvement.

We are happy to receive code extensions, bug fixes, documentation updates etc.

If you want to contribute to the code, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/pull/new/) that includes how you modified the code and what new functionality it has, the **OS it has been tested on**, and the **output of the [testscript.py](/examples/testscript.py)** and if you are editing the **3D code the [testscript_3d.py](/examples/testscript_3d.py)**.

We are especially seeking people from underrepresented backgrounds in OSS to contribute their expertise and experience. Please get in touch if you want to discuss specific contributions you are interested in developing, and we can help shape a road-map.
