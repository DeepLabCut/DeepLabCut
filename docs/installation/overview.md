# Overview
DeepLabCut can be run on **Windows**, **Linux**, or **MacOS**. We provide multiple ways to install, but the two main ways are using either a `conda`-based installation (**recommended**) [`Docker` container](docker-containers) (recommended for Ubuntu advanced users). 

**Our recommended route is to use `conda`**.
