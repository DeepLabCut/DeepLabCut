Note: This was done in the course of my studies as a Bachelor's project in the Straw Lab at the University of Freiburg.
The Straw Lab(https://strawlab.org/) is interested in real-time flies tracking, so the cost metric
& other stuff were specifically chosen with the regard to the input.

More Notes
- The Kalman filter is a constant velocity model

- Evaluation was done using only the initial input videos (See picture in header)

- This feature merely tested on DLC2, as it was developed under DLC1
