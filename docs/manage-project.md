# Managing Your DeepLabCut Project

## Editing the Configuration File

Upon creating your project, you will return to the main GUI window and start your work at the **Project Management Tab**.
You will notice the file path to the configuration file at the top of the window and the option **Edit config.yaml**. 

Click on **`Edit config.yaml`** to :
-  Define the bodyparts you wish to track.
-  Define the skeleton.

A new window called **`Configuration Editor`** will appear with all the configuration information. Modify the information on this file based on the needs of your research.

### Defining bodyparts

One of the categories on this window is called **`bodyparts`**. Click on the arrow next to this choice and a list will unfold underneath. Modify this list with the correct names. Insert additional rows as needed - just right click on the number and choose **`Insert`**.

### Defining the skeleton

When you are happy with your bodyparts list, continue down the window to modify the skeleton. Similarly, click on the arrow next to the skeleton, unravel the skeleton list and adjust the bodyparts pairs. 

>**ðŸ’¡Tip: If it is your first time spent some time to visualise your chosen bodyparts and how best to connect them to create a nice skeleton.**

### Save

When you finish editing, click on **`Save`**, to save your changes and return to the main GUI window.
