    ''' Returns the training and test pose config file names as well as the folder where the snapshot is
    Parameter
    ----------
    config : string
        Full path of the config.yaml file as a string.

    shuffle: int, optional
        Integer value specifying the shuffle index to select for training. Default is set to 1

    trainingsetindex: int, optional
        Integer specifying which TrainingsetFraction to use. By default the first (note that TrainingFraction is a list in config.yaml).

    Returns the triple: trainposeconfigfile, testposeconfigfile, snapshotfolder

    """Trains the network with the labels in the training dataset.

    Parameter
    ----------
    config : string
        Full path of the config.yaml file as a string.

    shuffle: int, optional
        Integer value specifying the shuffle index to select for training. Default is set to 1

    trainingsetindex: int, optional
        Integer specifying which TrainingsetFraction to use. By default the first (note that TrainingFraction is a list in config.yaml).

    gputouse: int, optional. Natural number indicating the number of your GPU (see number in nvidia-smi). If you do not have a GPU put None.
        See: https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3751/~/useful-nvidia-smi-queries

    Additional parameters:

    max_snapshots_to_keep: int, or None. Sets how many snapshots are kept, i.e. states of the trained network. Every savinginteration many times
        a snapshot is stored, however only the last max_snapshots_to_keep many are kept! If you change this to None, then all are kept.
        See: https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/issues/8#issuecomment-387404835

    autotune: property of TensorFlow, somehow faster if 'false' (as Eldar found out, see https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/13317). Default: False

    displayiters: this variable is actually set in pose_config.yaml. However, you can overwrite it with this hack. Don't use this regularly, just if you are too lazy to dig out
        the pose_config.yaml file for the corresponding project. If None, the value from there is used, otherwise it is overwritten! Default: None

    saveiters: this variable is actually set in pose_config.yaml. However, you can overwrite it with this hack. Don't use this regularly, just if you are too lazy to dig out
        the pose_config.yaml file for the corresponding project. If None, the value from there is used, otherwise it is overwritten! Default: None

    maxiters: this variable is actually set in pose_config.yaml. However, you can overwrite it with this hack. Don't use this regularly, just if you are too lazy to dig out
        the pose_config.yaml file for the corresponding project. If None, the value from there is used, otherwise it is overwritten! Default: None

    keepdeconvweights: bool, default: true
        Also restores the weights of the deconvolution layers (and the backbone) when training from a snapshot. Note that if you change the number of bodyparts, you need to
        set this to false for re-training.

    Example
    --------
    for training the network for first shuffle of the training dataset.
    >>> deeplabcut.train_network('/analysis/project/reaching-task/config.yaml')
    --------

    for training the network for second shuffle of the training dataset.
    >>> deeplabcut.train_network('/analysis/project/reaching-task/config.yaml',shuffle=2)
