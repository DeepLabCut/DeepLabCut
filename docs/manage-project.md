# Managing Your DeepLabCut Project

## Editing the Configuration File

After creating your DeepLabCut project, you'll return to the main GUI window, where you'll start managing your project from the **Project Management Tab**.

### Accessing the Configuration File

- **Locate the Configuration File:** At the top of the window, you'll find the file path to the configuration file.
- **Edit the File:** Click on **`Edit config.yaml`**. This action allows you to:
  - Define the bodyparts you wish to track.
  - Outline the skeleton structure.

A **`Configuration Editor`** window will open, displaying all the configuration details. You'll need to modify some of these settings to align with your research requirements.

### Steps to Edit the Configuration

#### 1. Defining Bodyparts

- **Locate the Bodyparts Section:** In the Configuration Editor, find the **`bodyparts`** category.
- **Modify the List:** Click on the arrow next to **`bodyparts`** to expand the list. Here, you can:
  - Update the list with the names of the bodyparts relevant to your study.
  - Add more entries by right-clicking on a row number and selecting **`Insert`**.

#### 2. Defining the Skeleton

- **Navigate to the Skeleton Section:** Scroll down to the **`skeleton`** category.
- **Adjust the Skeleton List:** Click on the arrow to expand this section. You can then:
  - Update the pairs of bodyparts to define the skeleton structure of your model.

> 💡 **Tip:** If you're new to DeepLabCut, spend some time visualizing how the chosen bodyparts can be connected effectively to form a coherent skeleton.

### Saving Your Changes

- **Save the Configuration:** Once you're satisfied with the modifications, click **`Save`**. This will store your changes and return you to the main GUI window.
