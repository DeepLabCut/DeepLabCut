    Note that in order for your custom benchmark to be included during
    evaluation, the following conditions need to be met:

        - The benchmark subclassed one of the benchmark definitions in
          in ``benchmark.benchmarks``
        - The benchmark is registered by applying the ``@benchmark.register``
          decorator to the class
        - The benchmark was imported. This is done automatically for all
          benchmarks that are defined in submodules or subpackages of the
          ``benchmark.submissions`` module. For all other locations, make
          sure to manually import the packages **before** calling the
          ``evaluate()`` function.

    Args:
        include_benchmarks:
            If ``None``, run all benchmarks that were discovered. If a container
            is passed, only include methods that were defined on benchmarks with
            the specified names. E.g., ``include_benchmarks = ["trimouse"]`` would
            only evaluate methods of the trimouse benchmark dataset.
        on_error:
            see documentation in ``benchmark.base.Benchmark.evaluate()``

    Returns:
        A collection of all results, which can be printed or exported to
        ``pd.DataFrame`` or ``json`` file formats.
