    """Trains the network with the labels in the training dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : string
        Full path of the config.yaml file as a string.

    shuffle: int, optional, default=1
        Integer value specifying the shuffle index to select for training.

    trainingsetindex: int, optional, default=0
        Integer specifying which TrainingsetFraction to use.
        Note that TrainingFraction is a list in config.yaml.

    max_snapshots_to_keep: int or None
        Sets how many snapshots are kept, i.e. states of the trained network. Every
        saving iteration many times a snapshot is stored, however only the last
        ``max_snapshots_to_keep`` many are kept! If you change this to None, then all
        are kept.
        See: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/8#issuecomment-387404835

    displayiters: optional, default=None
        This variable is actually set in ``pose_config.yaml``. However, you can
        overwrite it with this hack. Don't use this regularly, just if you are too lazy
        to dig out the ``pose_config.yaml`` file for the corresponding project. If
        ``None``, the value from there is used, otherwise it is overwritten!

    saveiters: optional, default=None
        This variable is actually set in ``pose_config.yaml``. However, you can
        overwrite it with this hack. Don't use this regularly, just if you are too lazy
        to dig out the ``pose_config.yaml`` file for the corresponding project.
        If ``None``, the value from there is used, otherwise it is overwritten!

    maxiters: optional, default=None
        This variable is actually set in ``pose_config.yaml``. However, you can
        overwrite it with this hack. Don't use this regularly, just if you are too lazy
        to dig out the ``pose_config.yaml`` file for the corresponding project.
        If ``None``, the value from there is used, otherwise it is overwritten!

    allow_growth: bool, optional, default=True.
        For some smaller GPUs the memory issues happen. If ``True``, the memory
        allocator does not pre-allocate the entire specified GPU memory region, instead
        starting small and growing as needed.
        See issue: https://forum.image.sc/t/how-to-stop-running-out-of-vram/30551/2

    gputouse: optional, default=None
        Natural number indicating the number of your GPU (see number in nvidia-smi).
        If you do not have a GPU put None.
        See: https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3751/~/useful-nvidia-smi-queries

    autotune: bool, optional, default=False
        Property of TensorFlow, somehow faster if ``False``
        (as Eldar found out, see https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/13317).

    keepdeconvweights: bool, optional, default=True
        Also restores the weights of the deconvolution layers (and the backbone) when
        training from a snapshot. Note that if you change the number of bodyparts, you
        need to set this to false for re-training.

    modelprefix: str, optional, default=""
        Directory containing the deeplabcut models to use when evaluating the network.
        By default, the models are assumed to exist in the project folder.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Examples
    --------
    To train the network for first shuffle of the training dataset

    >>> deeplabcut.train_network('/analysis/project/reaching-task/config.yaml')

    To train the network for second shuffle of the training dataset

    >>> deeplabcut.train_network(
