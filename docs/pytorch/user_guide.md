# DeepLabCut 3.0 - PyTorch User Guide

## Using DeepLabCut 3.0

**DeepLabCut 3.0 keeps the same high-level API that you know, but has a full new PyTorch backend. 
Moreover, it is a rewrite that is more developer friendly, more powerful, and built for modern deep
learning-based computer vision applications.**

**NOTE**🔥: We suggest that if you're just starting with DeepLabCut you start with the
PyTorch backend. You will easily know which "engine" you are using by looking at the
main `config.yaml` file, or top right corner in the GUI. If you have DeepLabCut projects
in TensorFlow, we've got you covered too: you can seamlessly switch to train your
already labeled data by simply switching the engine (and thereby also compare
performance). In short, expect a boost 🔥.

In short, PyTorch models can be trained in any DeepLabCut project. If you have a project
already made,  simply add a new key to your project `config.yaml` file specifying
`engine: pytorch`. Then any new training dataset that will be created will be a PyTorch
model (see [Creating Shuffles and Model Configuration](
#Creating-Shuffles-and-Model-Configuration)) to learn more about training PyTorch
models. To train Tensorflow models again, you can set `engine: tensorflow`.

### Installation

To see the DeepLabCut 3.0 installation guide, check the [installation docs](how-to-install).

### Using the GUI

You can use the GUI to train DeepLabCut projects. You can switch between the PyTorch
and TensorFlow engine through the drop-down menu in the top right corner.

## Major changes

### From iterations to epochs

Pytorch models in DeepLabCut 3.0 are trained for a set number of `epochs`, instead of a 
maximum number of `iterations`. An epoch is a single pass through the training dataset, 
which means your model has seen each training image exactly once.

- So if you have 64 training images for your network, an epoch is 64 iterations with batch
size 1 (or 32 iterations with batch size 2, 16 with batch size 4, etc.).

## API

### Creating Shuffles and Model Configuration

You can configure models using the `pytorch_config.yaml` file, as described
[here](dlc3-pytorch-config). You can use the same methods to create new shuffles in 
DeepLabCut 3.0 as you did for Tensorflow models (`deeplabcut.create_training_dataset`
and `deeplabcut.create_training_model_comparison`).

More information about the different PyTorch model architectures available in DeepLabCut
is available [here](dlc3-pytorch-config). You can see a list of supported 
architectures/variants by using:

```python
from deeplabcut.pose_estimation_pytorch import available_models
print(available_models())
```

### Development State and Road Map 🚧

The table below describes the DeepLabCut API methods that have been implemented for the
PyTorch engine, as well as indications which options are not yet implemented, and which
parameters are not valid for the DLC 3.0 PyTorch API.
