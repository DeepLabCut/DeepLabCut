    Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks

        real-time object detection with region proposal networks." Advances in neural
        information processing systems 28 (2015).

    This class is a wrapper of the torchvision implementation of a FasterRCNN (source:
    https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/detection/faster_rcnn.py).

    Some of the available FasterRCNN variants (from fastest to most powerful):
      - fasterrcnn_mobilenet_v3_large_fpn
      - fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn
      - fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn_v2

    Args:
        variant: The FasterRCNN variant to use (see all options at
            https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html#object-detection).
        pretrained: Whether to load model weights pretrained on COCO
        box_score_thresh: during inference, only return proposals with a classification
            score greater than box_score_thresh
