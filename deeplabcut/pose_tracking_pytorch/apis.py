    """

    Performs tracking with transformer.

    Substeps include:

    Mines triplets from videos and these triplets are later used to tran a transformer that's
    able to perform reID. The transformer is then used as a stitching loss when tracklets are
    stitched during tracking.

    Outputs: The tracklet file is saved in the same folder where the non transformer tracklet file is stored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_config_file: string
        Full path of the config.yaml file as a string.

    dlcscorer: string
        dlcscorer that kepps track of the model it uses

    videos: list
        A list of strings containing the full paths to videos for analysis or a path to the directory, where all the videos with same extension are stored.

    n_tracks: int

        number of tracks to be formed in the videos. (TODO) handling videos with different number of tracks

    train_epochs: (optional), int

        number of epochs to train the transformer

    n_triplets: (optional) int

        number of triplets to be mined from the videos

    videotype: (optional) str
        extension for the video file
