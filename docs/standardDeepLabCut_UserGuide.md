# DeepLabCut User Guide (for single animal projects)

This document covers single/standard DeepLabCut use. If you have a complicated multi-animal scenario (i.e., they look
the same), then please see our [maDLC user guide](multi-animal-userguide).

To get started, you can use the GUI, or the terminal. See below.

## DeepLabCut Project Manager GUI (recommended for beginners)



**GUI:**

To begin, navigate to Anaconda Prompt Terminal and right-click to "open as admin "(Windows), or simply launch
"Terminal" (unix/MacOS) on your computer. We assume you have DeepLabCut installed (if not, see
[install docs](how-to-install)!). Next, launch your conda env (i.e., for example `conda activate DEEPLABCUT`). Then,
simply run `python -m deeplabcut`. The below functions are available to you in an easy-to-use graphical user interface.
While most functionality is available, advanced users might want the additional flexibility that command line interface
offers. Read more below.
```{Hint}
🚨 If you use Windows, please always open the terminal with administrator privileges! Right click, and "run as administrator".
```

</p>

As a reminder, the core functions are described in our
[Nature Protocols paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0176-0) (published at the time of 2.0.6).
Additional functions and features are continually added to the package. Thus, we recommend you read over the protocol
and then please look at the following documentation and the doctrings. Thanks for using DeepLabCut!

## DeepLabCut in the Terminal/Command line interface:

To begin, navigate to Anaconda Prompt Terminal and right-click to "open as admin "(Windows), or simply launch
"Terminal" (unix/MacOS) on your computer. We assume you have DeepLabCut installed (if not, see Install docs!). Next,
launch your conda env (i.e., for example `conda activate DEEPLABCUT`) and then type `ipython`. Then type:
```python
import deeplabcut
```

```{Hint}
🚨 If you use Windows, please always open the terminal with administrator privileges! Right click, and "run as administrator".
```

### (A) Create a New Project

The function `create_new_project` creates a new project directory, required subdirectories, and a basic project
configuration file. Each project is identified by the name of the project (e.g. Reaching), name of the experimenter
(e.g. YourName), as well as the date at creation.

Thus, this function requires the user to input the name of the project, the name of the experimenter, and the full
path of the videos that are (initially) used to create the training dataset.

Optional arguments specify the working directory, where the project directory will be created, and if the user wants
to copy the videos (to the project directory). If the optional argument `working_directory` is unspecified, the
project directory is created in the current working directory, and if `copy_videos` is unspecified symbolic links
for the videos are created in the videos directory. Each symbolic link creates a reference to a video and thus
eliminates the need to copy the entire video to the video directory (if the videos remain at the original location).

```python
deeplabcut.create_new_project(
    "Name of the project",
    "Name of the experimenter",
    ["Full path of video 1", "Full path of video2", "Full path of video3"],
    working_directory="Full path of the working directory",
    copy_videos=True/False,
    multianimal=False
)
```

**Important path formatting note**

Windows users, you must input paths as: `r'C:\Users\computername\Videos\reachingvideo1.avi'` or
` 'C:\\Users\\computername\\Videos\\reachingvideo1.avi'`

TIP: you can also place `config_path` in front of `deeplabcut.create_new_project` to create a variable that holds
the path to the config.yaml file, i.e. `config_path=deeplabcut.create_new_project(...)`

This set of arguments will create a project directory with the name
**<Name of the project>+<name of the experimenter>+<date of creation of the project>** in the **Working directory** and
creates the symbolic links to videos in the **videos** directory. The project directory will have subdirectories:
**dlc-models**, **dlc-models-pytorch**, **labeled-data**, **training-datasets**, and **videos**.  All the outputs
generated during the course of a project will be stored in one of these subdirectories, thus allowing each project to be
curated in separation from other projects. The purpose of the subdirectories is as follows:

**dlc-models** and **dlc-models-pytorch** have a similar structure; the first contains files for the TensorFlow engine
while the second contains files for the PyTorch engine. At the top level in these directories, there are directories
referring to different iterations of label refinement (see below): **iteration-0**, **iteration-1**, etc.
The iteration directories store shuffle directories, where each shuffle directory stores model data related to a
particular experiment: trained and tested on a particular training and testing sets, and with a particular model
architecture. Each shuffle directory contains the subdirectories *test* and *train*, each of which holds the meta
information with regard to the parameters of the feature detectors in configuration files. The configuration files are
YAML files, a common human-readable data serialization language. These files can be opened and edited with standard text
editors. The subdirectory *train* will store checkpoints (called snapshots) during training of the model. These
snapshots allow the user to reload the trained model without re-training it, or to pick-up training from a particular
saved checkpoint, in case the training was interrupted.

**labeled-data:** This directory will store the frames used to create the training dataset. Frames from different videos
are stored in separate subdirectories. Each frame has a filename related to the temporal index within the corresponding
video, which allows the user to trace every frame back to its origin.

**training-datasets:**  This directory will contain the training dataset used to train the network and metadata, which
contains information about how the training dataset was created.

**videos:** Directory of video links or videos. When **copy\_videos** is set to `False`, this directory contains
symbolic links to the videos. If it is set to `True` then the videos will be copied to this directory. The default is
`False`. Additionally, if the user wants to add new videos to the project at any stage, the function
**add\_new\_videos** can be used. This will update the list of videos in the project's configuration file.

```python
deeplabcut.add_new_videos(
    "Full path of the project configuration file*",
    ["full path of video 4", "full path of video 5"],
    copy_videos=True/False
)
```

*Please note, *Full path of the project configuration file* will be referenced as `config_path` throughout this
protocol.

The project directory also contains the main configuration file called *config.yaml*. The *config.yaml* file contains
many important parameters of the project. A complete list of parameters including their description can be found in
Box1.

The `create_new_project` step writes the following parameters to the configuration file: *Task*, *scorer*, *date*,
*project\_path* as well as a list of videos *video\_sets*. The first three parameters should **not** be changed. The
list of videos can be changed by adding new videos or manually removing videos.

### (B) Configure the Project

<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/1588892210304-EW7WD46PYAU43WWZS4QZ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAXtGtTuS2U1SVcl-tYMBOAUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8PaoYXhp6HxIwZIk7-Mi3Tsic-L2IOPH3Dwrhl-Ne3Z2YjE9w60pqfeJxDohDRZk1jXSVCSSfcEA7WmgMAGpjTehHAH51QaxKq4KdVMVBxpG/1nktc1kdgq2.jpg?format=1000w" width="175" title="colormaps" alt="DLC Utils" align="right" vspace = "50">

Next, open the **config.yaml** file, which was created during  **create\_new\_project**. You can edit this file in any
text editor.  Familiarize yourself with the meaning of the parameters (Box 1). You can edit various parameters, in
particular you **must add the list of *bodyparts* (or points of interest)** that you want to track. You can also set the
*colormap* here that is used for all downstream steps (can also be edited at anytime), like labeling GUIs, videos, etc.
Here any [matplotlib colormaps](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html) will do!
Please DO NOT have spaces in the names of bodyparts.

**bodyparts:** are the bodyparts of each individual (in the above list).


 ### (C) Select Frames to Label

**CRITICAL:** A good training dataset should consist of a sufficient number of frames that capture the breadth of the
behavior. This ideally implies to select the frames from different (behavioral) sessions, different lighting and
different animals, if those vary substantially (to train an invariant, robust feature detector). Thus for creating a
robust network that you can reuse in the laboratory, a good training dataset should reflect the diversity of the
behavior with respect to postures, luminance conditions, background conditions, animal identities,etc. of the data that
will be analyzed. For the simple lab behaviors comprising mouse reaching, open-field behavior and fly behavior, 100−200
frames gave good results [Mathis et al, 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y). However, depending on
the required accuracy, the nature of behavior, the video quality (e.g. motion blur, bad lighting) and the context, more
or less frames might be necessary to create a good network. Ultimately, in order to scale up the analysis to large
collections of videos with perhaps unexpected conditions, one can also refine the data set in an adaptive way (see
refinement below).

The function `extract_frames` extracts frames from all the videos in the project configuration file in order to create
a training dataset. The extracted frames from all the videos are stored in a separate subdirectory named after the video
file’s name under the ‘labeled-data’. This function also has various parameters that might be useful based on the user’s
need.
```python
deeplabcut.extract_frames(
    config_path,
    mode="automatic/manual",
    algo="uniform/kmeans",
    crop=True/False,
    userfeedback=False
)
```
**CRITICAL POINT:** It is advisable to keep the frame size small, as large frames increase the training and
inference time. The cropping parameters for each video can be provided in the config.yaml file (and see below).
When running the function extract_frames, if the parameter crop=True, then you will be asked to draw a box within the
GUI (and this is written to the config.yaml file).

`userfeedback` allows the user to specify which videos they wish to extract frames from. When set to `"True"`, a dialog
will be initiated, where the user is asked for each video if (additional/any) frames from this video should be
extracted. Use this, e.g. if you have already labeled some folders and want to extract data for new videos.

The provided function either selects frames from the videos that are randomly sampled from a uniform distribution
(uniform), by clustering based on visual appearance (k-means), or by manual selection. Random uniform selection of
frames works best for behaviors where the postures vary across the whole video. However, some behaviors might be sparse,
as in the case of reaching where the reach and pull are very fast and the mouse is not moving much between trials. In
such a case, the function that allows selecting frames based on k-means derived quantization would be useful. If the
user chooses to use k-means as a method to cluster the frames, then this function downsamples the video and clusters the
frames using k-means, where each frame is treated as a vector. Frames from different clusters are then selected. This
procedure makes sure that the frames look different. However, on large and long videos, this code is slow due to
computational complexity.

**CRITICAL POINT:** It is advisable to extract frames from a period of the video that contains interesting
behaviors, and not extract the frames across the whole video. This can be achieved by using the start and stop
parameters in the config.yaml file. Also, the user can change the number of frames to extract from each video using
the numframes2extract in the config.yaml file.

However, picking frames is highly dependent on the data and the behavior being studied. Therefore, it is hard to
provide all purpose code that extracts frames to create a good training dataset for every behavior and animal. If the
user feels specific frames are lacking, they can extract hand selected frames of interest using the interactive GUI
provided along with the toolbox. This can be launched by using:
```python
deeplabcut.extract_frames(config_path, "manual")
```
The user can use the *Load Video* button to load one of the videos in the project configuration file, use the scroll
bar to navigate across the video and *Grab a Frame* (or a range of frames, as of version 2.0.5) to extract the frame(s).
The user can also look at the extracted frames and e.g. delete frames (from the directory) that are too similar before
reloading the set and then manually annotating them.

### (D) Label Frames

The toolbox provides a function **label_frames** which helps the user to easily label
all the extracted frames using an interactive graphical user interface (GUI). The user
should have already named the bodyparts to label (points of interest) in the
project’s configuration file by providing a list. The following command invokes the
napari-deeplabcut labelling GUI. Checkout the [napari-deeplabcut docs](napari-gui) for
more information about the labelling workflow.

```python
deeplabcut.label_frames(config_path)
```

[🎥 DEMO](https://youtu.be/hsA9IB5r73E)

HOT KEYS IN THE Labeling GUI (also see "help" in GUI):

```
Ctrl + C: Copy labels from previous frame.
Keyboard arrows: advance frames.
Delete key: delete label.
```

![hot keys](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/192345a5-e411-4d56-b718-ef52f91e195e/Qwerty.png?format=2500w)

**CRITICAL POINT:** It is advisable to **consistently label similar spots** (e.g., on a wrist that is very large, try
to label the same location). In general, invisible or occluded points should not be labeled by the user. They can
simply be skipped by not applying the label anywhere on the frame.

OPTIONAL: In the event of adding more labels to the existing labeled dataset, the user need to append the new
labels to the bodyparts in the config.yaml file. Thereafter, the user can call the function **label_frames**. As of
2.0.5+: then a box will pop up and ask the user if they wish to display all parts, or only add in the new labels.
Saving the labels after all the images are labelled will append the new labels to the existing labeled dataset.

For more information, checkout the [napari-deeplabcut docs](napari-gui) for 
more information about the labelling workflow.

### (E) Check Annotated Frames

OPTIONAL: Checking if the labels were created and stored correctly is beneficial for training, since labeling
is one of the most critical parts for creating the training dataset. The DeepLabCut toolbox provides a function
‘check_labels’ to do so. It is used as follows:
```python
deeplabcut.check_labels(config_path, visualizeindividuals=True/False)
 ```

For each video directory in labeled-data this function creates a subdirectory with **labeled** as a suffix. Those
directories contain the frames plotted with the annotated body parts. The user can double check if the body parts are
labeled correctly. If they are not correct, the user can reload the frames (i.e. `deeplabcut.label_frames`), move them
around, and click save again.

### (F) Create Training Dataset

**CRITICAL POINT:** Only run this step **where** you are going to train the network. If you label on your laptop but
move your project folder to Google Colab or AWS, lab server, etc, then run the step below on that platform! If you
labeled on a Windows machine but train on Linux, this is fine as of 2.0.4 onwards it will be done automatically (it
saves file sets as both Linux and Windows for you).

- If you move your project folder, you must only change the `project_path` (which is done automatically) in the main
config.yaml file - that's it - no need to change the video paths, etc! Your project is fully portable.

- Be aware you select your neural network backbone at this stage. As of DLC3+ we support PyTorch (and TensorFlow, but
this will be phased out). 

**OVERVIEW:** This function combines the labeled datasets from all the videos and splits them to create train and test
datasets. The training data will be used to train the network, while the test data set will be used for evaluating the
network.

```python
deeplabcut.create_training_dataset(config_path)
```

- OPTIONAL: If the user wishes to benchmark the performance of the DeepLabCut, they can create multiple training
datasets by specifying an integer value to the `num_shuffles`; see the docstring for more details.

The function creates a new shuffle(s) directory in the **dlc-models-pytorch** directory
(**dlc-models** if using Tensorflow), in the current "iteration" directory.
The `train` and `test` directories each have a configuration file
(**pytorch_config.yaml** in **train** and **pose_cfg.yaml** in **test** for Pytorch models,
**pose_cfg.yaml** in **train** and **test** for Tensorflow models).
Specifically, the user can edit the **pytorch_config.yaml** (or **pose_cfg.yaml**) within the **train** subdirectory
before starting the training. These configuration files contain meta information with regard to the parameters
of the feature detectors. For more information about the **pytorch_config.yaml** file, see [here](dlc3-pytorch-config)
(for TensorFlow-based models, see key parameters
[here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/main/deeplabcut/pose_cfg.yaml)).

**CRITICAL POINT:** At this step, for **create_training_dataset** you select the network you want to use, and any
additional data augmentation (beyond our defaults). You can set `net_type`, `detector_type` (if using a detector)
and `augmenter_type` when you call the function.

- Networks: ImageNet pre-trained networks OR SuperAnimal pre-trained networks weights will be downloaded, as you
select. You can decide to do transfer-learning (recommended) or "fine-tune" both the backbone and the decoder head. We
suggest seeing our [dedicated documentation on models](dlc3-architectures) for more information (
or the [this page on selecting models](what-neural-network-should-i-use) for the TensorFlow engine).

```{Hint}
🚨 If they do not download (you will see this downloading in the terminal), then you may not have permission to do
so - be sure to open your terminal "as an admin" (This is only something we have seen with some Windows users - see
the **[docs for more help!](tf-training-tips-and-tricks)**).
```

**DATA AUGMENTATION:** At this stage you can also decide what type of augmentation to
use. Once you've called `create_training_dataset`, you can edit the
[**pytorch_config.yaml**](dlc3-pytorch-config) file that was created (or for the
TensorFlow engine, the [**pose_cfg.yaml**](
https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/main/deeplabcut/pose_cfg.yaml) file).

- PyTorch Engine: [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/docs/) is used for data
augmentation. Look at the [**pytorch_config.yaml**](dlc3-pytorch-config) for more
information about image augmentation options.
- TensorFlow Engine: The default augmentation works well for most tasks (as shown on
www.deeplabcut.org), but there are many options, more data augmentation, intermediate
supervision, etc. Here are the available loaders:
  - `imgaug`: a lot of augmentation possibilities, efficient code for target map creation & batch sizes >1 supported.
  You can set the parameters such as the `batch_size` in the `pose_cfg.yaml` file for the model you are training. This
  is the recommended default!
  - `crop_scale`: our standard DLC 2.0 introduced in Nature Protocols variant (scaling, auto-crop augmentation)
  - `tensorpack`: a lot of augmentation possibilities, multi CPU support for fast processing, target maps are created
  less efficiently than in imgaug, does not allow batch size>1
  - `deterministic`: only useful for testing, freezes numpy seed; otherwise like default.

**MODEL COMPARISON**: You can also test several models by creating the same train/test
split for different networks.
You can easily do this in the Project Manager GUI (by selecting the "Use an existing 
data split" option), which also lets you compare PyTorch and TensorFlow models.

````{versionadded} 3.0.0
You can now create new shuffles using the same train/test split as 
existing shuffles with `create_training_dataset_from_existing_split`. This allows you to
compare model performance (between different architectures or when using different
training hyper-parameters) as the shuffles were trained on the same data, and evaluated
on the same test data!

Example usage - creating 3 new shuffles (with indices 10, 11 and 12) for a ResNet 50
pose estimation model, using the same data split as was used for shuffle 0:

```python
deeplabcut.create_training_dataset_from_existing_split(
    config_path,
    from_shuffle=0,
    shuffles=[10, 11, 12],
    net_type="resnet_50",
)
```

### (G) Train The Network

The function ‘train_network’ helps the user in training the network. It is used as follows:
```python
deeplabcut.train_network(config_path)
```
The set of arguments in the function starts training the network for the dataset created
for one specific shuffle. Note that you can change training parameters in the 
[**pytorch_config.yaml**](dlc3-pytorch-config) file (or **pose_cfg.yaml** for TensorFlow
models) of the model that you want to train (before you start training).

At user specified iterations during training checkpoints are stored in the subdirectory 
*train* under the respective iteration & shuffle directory.

````{admonition} Tips on training models with the PyTorch Engine
:class: dropdown

Example parameters that one can call:

```python
deeplabcut.train_network(
    config_path,
    shuffle=1,
    trainingsetindex=0,
    device="cuda:0",
    max_snapshots_to_keep=5,
    displayiters=100,
    save_epochs=5,
    epochs=200,
)
```

Pytorch models in DeepLabCut 3.0 are trained for a set number of epochs, instead of a
maximum number of iterations (which is what was used for TensorFlow models). An epoch
is a single pass through the training dataset, which means your model has seen each
training image exactly once. So if you have 64 training images for your network, an
epoch is 64 iterations with batch size 1 (or 32 iterations with batch size 2, 16 with
batch size 4, etc.).

By default, the pretrained networks are not in the DeepLabCut toolbox (as they can be 
more than 100MB), but they get downloaded automatically before you train.

If the user wishes to restart the training at a specific checkpoint they can specify the
full path of the checkpoint to the variable ``resume_training_from`` in the [
**pytorch_config.yaml**](
dlc3-pytorch-config) file (checkout the "Restarting Training at a Specific Checkpoint"
section of the docs) under the *train* subdirectory.

**CRITICAL POINT:** It is recommended to train the networks **until the loss plateaus** 
(depending on the dataset, model architecture and training hyper-parameters this happens
after 100 to 250 epochs of training).

The variables ``display_iters`` and ``save_epochs`` in the [**pytorch_config.yaml**](
dlc3-pytorch-config) file allows the user to alter how often the loss is displayed
and how often the weights are stored. We suggest saving every 5 to 25 epochs.
````

````{admonition} Tips on training models with the TensorFlow Engine 
:class: dropdown

Example parameters that one can call:

```python
deeplabcut.train_network(
    config_path,
    shuffle=1,
    trainingsetindex=0,
    gputouse=None,
    max_snapshots_to_keep=5,
    autotune=False,
    displayiters=100,
    saveiters=25000,
    maxiters=300000,
    allow_growth=True,
)
```

By default, the pretrained networks are not in the DeepLabCut toolbox (as they are 
around 100MB each), but they get downloaded before you train. However, if not previously
downloaded from the TensorFlow model weights, it will be downloaded and stored in a
subdirectory *pre-trained* under the subdirectory *models* in 
*Pose_Estimation_Tensorflow*. At user specified iterations during training checkpoints
are stored in the subdirectory *train* under the respective iteration directory.

If the user wishes to restart the training at a specific checkpoint they can specify the
full path of the checkpoint to the variable ``init_weights`` in the **pose_cfg.yaml**
file under the *train* subdirectory (see Box 2).

**CRITICAL POINT:** It is recommended to train the networks for thousands of iterations
until the loss plateaus (typically around **500,000**) if you use batch size 1. If you
want to batch train, we recommend using Adam,
[see more here](tf-custom-image-augmentation).

The variables ``display_iters`` and ``save_iters`` in the **pose_cfg.yaml** file allows
the user to alter how often the loss is displayed and how often the weights are stored.

**maDeepLabCut CRITICAL POINT:** For multi-animal projects we are using not only
different and new output layers, but also new data augmentation, optimization, learning
rates, and batch training defaults. Thus, please use a lower ``save_iters`` and
``maxiters``. I.e. we suggest saving every 10K-15K iterations, and only training until
50K-100K iterations. We recommend you look closely at the loss to not overfit on your
data. The bonus, training time is much less!!!

### (H) Evaluate the Trained Network

It is important to evaluate the performance of the trained network. This performance is measured by computing
the average root mean square error (RMSE) between the manual labels and the ones predicted by DeepLabCut.
The RMSE is saved as a comma separated file and displayed for all pairs and only likely pairs (>p-cutoff).
This helps to exclude, for example, occluded body parts. One of the strengths of DeepLabCut is that due to the
probabilistic output of the scoremap, it can, if sufficiently trained, also reliably report if a body part is visible
in a given frame. (see discussions of finger tips in reaching and the Drosophila legs during 3D behavior in
[Mathis et al, 2018]). The evaluation results are computed by typing:

```python
deeplabcut.evaluate_network(config_path, Shuffles=[1], plotting=True)
```

Setting `plotting` to true plots all the testing and training frames with the manual and predicted labels. The user
should visually check the labeled test (and training) images that are created in the ‘evaluation-results’ directory.
Ideally, DeepLabCut labeled unseen (test images) according to the user’s required accuracy, and the average train
and test errors are comparable (good generalization). What (numerically) comprises an acceptable RMSE depends on
many factors (including the size of the tracked body parts, the labeling variability, etc.). Note that the test error
can also be larger than the training error due to human variability (in labeling, see Figure 2 in Mathis et al, Nature
Neuroscience 2018).

**Optional parameters:**

- `Shuffles: list, optional` - List of integers specifying the shuffle indices of the training dataset.
The default is [1]

- `plotting: bool, optional` - Plots the predictions on the train and test images. The default is `False`;
if provided it must be either `True` or `False`

- `show_errors: bool, optional` - Display train and test errors. The default is `True`

- `comparisonbodyparts: list of bodyparts, Default is all` - The average error will be computed for those body parts
only (Has to be a subset of the body parts).

- `gputouse: int, optional` - Natural number indicating the number of your GPU (see number in nvidia-smi). If you do not
have a GPU, put None. See: https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3751/~/useful-nvidia-smi-queries

The plots can be customized by editing the **config.yaml** file (i.e., the colormap, scale, marker size (dotsize), and
transparency of labels (alphavalue) can be modified). By default each body part is plotted in a different color
(governed by the colormap) and the plot labels indicate their source. Note that by default the human labels are
plotted as plus (‘+’), DeepLabCut’s predictions either as ‘.’ (for confident predictions with likelihood > p-cutoff) and
’x’ for (likelihood <= `pcutoff`).

The evaluation results for each shuffle of the training dataset are stored in a unique subdirectory in a newly created
directory ‘evaluation-results-pytorch’ (‘evaluation-results’ for tensorflow models) in the project directory.
The user can visually inspect if the distance between the labeled and the predicted body parts are acceptable.
In the event of benchmarking with different shuffles of same training dataset, the user can provide multiple shuffle
indices to evaluate the corresponding network.
Note that with multi-animal projects additional distance statistics aggregated over animals or bodyparts are also stored
in that directory. This aims at providing a finer quantitative evaluation of multi-animal prediction performance
before animal tracking. If the generalization is not sufficient, the user might want to:

• check if the labels were imported correctly; i.e., invisible points are not labeled and the points of interest are
labeled accurately

• make sure that the loss has already converged

• consider labeling additional images and make another iteration of the training data set

**OPTIONAL:** You can also plot the scoremaps, locref layers, and PAFs:

```python
deeplabcut.extract_save_all_maps(config_path, shuffle=shuffle, Indices=[0, 5])
```
you can drop "Indices" to run this on all training/testing images (this is slow!)

### (I) Analyze new Videos

The trained network can be used to analyze new videos. Novel/new videos **DO NOT have to be in the config file!**.
You can analyze new videos anytime by simply using the following line of code:
```python
deeplabcut.analyze_videos(
    config_path, ["fullpath/analysis/project/videos/reachingvideo1.avi"],
    save_as_csv=True
)
```
There are several other optional inputs, such as:
```python
deeplabcut.analyze_videos(
    config_path,
    videos,
    videotype="avi",
    shuffle=1,
    trainingsetindex=0,
    gputouse=None,
    save_as_csv=False,
    destfolder=None,
    dynamic=(True, .5, 10)
)
```
The user can choose a checkpoint for analyzing the videos. For this, the user can enter the corresponding index of the
checkpoint to the variable snapshotindex in the config.yaml file. By default, the most recent checkpoint (i.e. last) is
used for analyzing the video.
The labels are stored in a MultiIndex [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) Array, which contains the name of the network,
body part name, (x, y) label position in pixels, and the likelihood for each frame per body part. These arrays are
stored in an efficient Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) in the same directory, where the video is stored.
However, if the flag `save_as_csv` is set to `True`, the data can also be exported in comma-separated values format
(.csv), which in turn can be imported in many programs, such as MATLAB, R, Prism, etc.; This flag is set to `False`
by default. You can also set a destination folder (`destfolder`) for the output files by passing a path of the folder
you wish to write to.

### Novel Video Analysis: extra features

#### Dynamic-cropping of videos:

As of 2.1+ we have a dynamic cropping option. Namely, if you have large frames and the animal/object occupies a smaller
fraction, you can crop around your animal/object to make processing speeds faster. For example, if you have a large open
field experiment but only track the mouse, this will speed up your analysis (also helpful for real-time applications).
To use this simply add `dynamic=(True,.5,10)` when you call `analyze_videos`.

```python
dynamic: triple containing (state, detectiontreshold, margin)

    If the state is true, then dynamic cropping will be performed.
    That means that if an object is detected (i.e., any body part > detectiontreshold),
    then object boundaries are computed according to the smallest/largest x position and
    smallest/largest y position of all body parts. This window is expanded by the margin
    and from then on only the posture within this crop is analyzed (until the object is lost;
    i.e., < detectiontreshold). The current position is utilized for updating the crop window
    for the next frame (this is why the margin is important and should be set large enough
    given the movement of the animal).
```
### (J) Filter Pose Data

You can also filter the predictions with a median filter (default) or with a [SARIMAX model](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX.html), if you wish. This creates a new .h5 file with the ending *_filtered* that you can use in create_labeled_data and/or plot trajectories.
```python
deeplabcut.filterpredictions(
    config_path,
    ["fullpath/analysis/project/videos/reachingvideo1.avi"]
)
```
  An example call:
```python
deeplabcut.filterpredictions(
    config_path,
    ["fullpath/analysis/project/videos"],
    videotype=".mp4",
    filtertype="arima",
    ARdegree=5,
    MAdegree=2
)
```
  Here are parameters you can modify and pass:
```python
deeplabcut.filterpredictions(
    config_path,
    ["fullpath/analysis/project/videos/reachingvideo1.avi"],
    shuffle=1,
    trainingsetindex=0,
    filtertype="arima",
    p_bound=0.01,
    ARdegree=3,
    MAdegree=1,
    alpha=0.01
)
```
 Here is an example of how this can be applied to a video:

### (K) Plot Trajectories

The plotting components of this toolbox utilizes matplotlib. Therefore, these plots can easily be customized by
the end user. We also provide a function to plot the trajectory of the extracted poses across the analyzed video, which
can be called by typing:

```
deeplabcut.plot_trajectories(config_path, [‘fullpath/analysis/project/videos/reachingvideo1.avi’])
```

It creates a folder called `plot-poses` (in the directory of the video). The plots display the coordinates of body parts
vs. time, likelihoods vs time, the x- vs. y- coordinate of the body parts, as well as histograms of consecutive
coordinate differences. These plots help the user to quickly assess the tracking performance for a video. Ideally, the
likelihood stays high and the histogram of consecutive coordinate differences has values close to zero (i.e. no jumps in
body part detections across frames). Here are example plot outputs on a demo video (left):

### (L) Create Labeled Videos

Additionally, the toolbox provides a function to create labeled videos based on the extracted poses by plotting the
labels on top of the frame and creating a video. There are two modes to create videos: FAST and SLOW (but higher
quality!). One can use the command as follows to create multiple labeled videos:
```python
deeplabcut.create_labeled_video(
    config_path,
    ["fullpath/analysis/project/videos/reachingvideo1.avi",
     "fullpath/analysis/project/videos/reachingvideo2.avi"],
    save_frames = True/False
)
```
 Optionally, if you want to use the filtered data for a video or directory of filtered videos pass `filtered=True`,
 i.e.:
```python
deeplabcut.create_labeled_video(
    config_path,
    ["fullpath/afolderofvideos"],
    videotype=".mp4",
    filtered=True
)
```
You can also optionally add a skeleton to connect points and/or add a history of points for visualization. To set the
"trailing points" you need to pass `trailpoints`:
```python
deeplabcut.create_labeled_video(
    config_path,
    ["fullpath/afolderofvideos"],
    videotype=".mp4",
    trailpoints=10
)
```
To draw a skeleton, you need to first define the pairs of connected nodes (in the `config.yaml` file) and set the
skeleton color (in the `config.yaml` file). There is also a GUI to help you do this, use by calling
`deeplabcut.SkeletonBuilder(configpath)`!

Here is how the `config.yaml` additions/edits should look (for example, on the Openfield demo data we provide):
```python
# Plotting configuration
skeleton:
  - ["snout", "leftear"]
  - ["snout", "rightear"]
  - ["leftear", "tailbase"]
  - ["leftear", "rightear"]
  - ["rightear", "tailbase"]
skeleton_color: white
pcutoff: 0.4
dotsize: 4
alphavalue: 0.5
colormap: jet
```
Then pass `draw_skeleton=True` with the command:
```python
deeplabcut.create_labeled_video(
    config_path,
    ["fullpath/afolderofvideos"],
    videotype=".mp4",
    draw_skeleton=True
)
```

**NEW** as of 2.2b8: You can create a video with only the "dots" plotted, i.e., in the
[style of Johansson](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00309043), by passing `keypoints_only=True`:

```python
deeplabcut.create_labeled_video(
    config_path,["fullpath/afolderofvideos"],
    videotype=".mp4",
    keypoints_only=True
)
```

**PRO TIP:** that the **best quality videos** are created when `fastmode=False` is passed. Therefore, when
`trailpoints` and `draw_skeleton` are used, we **highly** recommend you also pass `fastmode=False`!

 <p align="center">
<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/1559935526258-KFYZC8BDHK01ZIDPNVIX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJbosy0LGK_KqcAZRQ_Qph1Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpzkC6kmM1CbNgeHQVxASNv0wiXikHv274BIFe4LR7nd1rKmAka4uxYMJ9FupazBoaU/mouse_skel_trail.gif?format=750w" width="40%">
</p>

This function has various other parameters, in particular the user can set the `colormap`, the `dotsize`, and
`alphavalue` of the labels in **config.yaml** file.

#### Extract "Skeleton" Features:

NEW, as of 2.0.7+: You can save the "skeleton" that was applied in `create_labeled_videos` for more computations.
Namely,  it extracts length and orientation of each "bone" of the skeleton as defined in the **config.yaml** file. You
can use the function by:

```python
deeplabcut.analyzeskeleton(
    config,
    video,
    videotype="avi",
    shuffle=1,
    trainingsetindex=0,
    save_as_csv=False,
    destfolder=None
)

### (M) Optional Active Learning -> Network Refinement: Extract Outlier Frames

While DeepLabCut typically generalizes well across datasets, one might want to optimize its performance in various,
perhaps unexpected, situations. For generalization to large data sets, images with insufficient labeling performance
can be extracted, manually corrected by adjusting the labels to increase the training set and iteratively improve the
feature detectors. Such an active learning framework can be used to achieve a predefined level of confidence for all
images with minimal labeling cost (discussed in Mathis et al 2018). Then, due to the large capacity of the neural network that underlies the feature detectors, one can continue training the network with these additional examples. One does not
necessarily need to correct all errors as common errors could be eliminated by relabeling a few examples and then
re-training. A priori, given that there is no ground truth data for analyzed videos, it is challenging to find putative
“outlier frames”. However, one can use heuristics such as the continuity of body part trajectories, to identify images
where the decoder might make large errors.

All this can be done for a specific video by typing (see other optional inputs below):

```python
deeplabcut.extract_outlier_frames(config_path, ["videofile_path"])
```

We provide various frame-selection methods for this purpose. In particular
the user can set:

```
outlieralgorithm: "fitting", "jump", or "uncertain"
```
• `outlieralgorithm="uncertain"`: select frames if the likelihood of a particular or all body parts lies below `p_bound`
(note this could also be due to occlusions rather than errors).

• `outlieralgorithm="jump"`: select frames where a particular body part or all body parts jumped more than `epsilon`
pixels from the last frame.

• `outlieralgorithm="fitting"`: select frames if the predicted body part location deviates from a state-space model fit
to the time series of individual body parts. Specifically, this method fits an Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) model to the time series for each body part. Thereby each body part detection with a likelihood smaller than
`p_bound` is treated as missing data.  Putative outlier frames are then identified as time points, where the average
body part estimates are at least `epsilon` pixels away from the fits. The parameters of this method are `epsilon`,
`p_bound`, the ARIMA parameters as well as the list of body parts to average over (can also be `all`).

• `outlieralgorithm="manual"`: manually select outlier frames based on visual inspection from the user.

 As an example:
```python
deeplabcut.extract_outlier_frames(config_path, ["videofile_path"], outlieralgorithm="manual")
```

In general, depending on the parameters, these methods might return much more frames than the user wants to
extract (`numframes2pick`). Thus, this list is then used to select outlier frames either by randomly sampling from
this list (`extractionalgorithm="uniform"`), by performing `extractionalgorithm="kmeans"` clustering on the
corresponding frames.

In the automatic configuration, before the frame selection happens, the user is informed about the amount of frames
satisfying the criteria and asked if the selection should proceed. This step allows the user to perhaps change the
parameters of the frame-selection heuristics first (i.e. to make sure that not too many frames are qualified). The user
can run the `extract_outlier_frames` method iteratively, and (even) extract additional frames from the same video.
Once enough outlier frames are extracted the refinement GUI can be used to adjust the labels based on user feedback
(see below).

 ### (N) Refine Labels: Augmentation of the Training Dataset

 Based on the performance of DeepLabCut, four scenarios are possible:

(A) Visible body part with accurate DeepLabCut prediction. These labels do not need any modifications.

(B) Visible body part but wrong DeepLabCut prediction. Move the label’s location to the actual position of the
body part.

(C) Invisible, occluded body part. Remove the predicted label by DeepLabCut with a middle click. Every predicted
label is shown, even when DeepLabCut is uncertain. This is necessary, so that the user can potentially move
the predicted label. However, to help the user to remove all invisible body parts the low-likelihood predictions
are shown as open circles (rather than disks).

(D) Invalid images: In the unlikely event that there are any invalid images, the user should remove such an image
and their corresponding predictions, if any. Here, the GUI will prompt the user to remove an image identified
as invalid.

The labels for extracted putative outlier frames can be refined by opening the GUI:
```python
deeplabcut.refine_labels(config_path)
```
This will launch a GUI where the user can refine the labels.

Please refer to the [napari-deeplabcut docs](napari-gui) for more information about the labelling workflow.

After correcting the labels for all the frames in each of the subdirectories, the users should merge the data set to
create a new dataset. In this step the iteration parameter in the config.yaml file is automatically updated.
```python
deeplabcut.merge_datasets(config_path)
```
Once the dataset is merged, the user can test if the merging process was successful by plotting all the labels (Step E).
Next, with this expanded training set the user can now create a novel training set and train the network as described
in Steps F and G. The training dataset will be stored in the same place as before but under a different `iteration-#`
subdirectory, where the ``#`` is the new value of `iteration` variable stored in the project’s configuration file
(this is automatically done).

Now you can run `create_training_dataset`, then `train_network`, etc. If your original labels were adjusted at all,
start from fresh weights (the typically recommended path anyhow), otherwise consider using your already trained network
weights (see Box 2).

If after training the network generalizes well to the data, proceed to analyze new videos. Otherwise, consider labeling
more data.

### Jupyter Notebooks for Demonstration of the DeepLabCut Workflow

We also provide two Jupyter notebooks for using DeepLabCut on both a pre-labeled dataset, and on the end user’s
own dataset. Firstly, we prepared an interactive Jupyter notebook called
[Demo_yourowndata.ipynb](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/main/examples/JUPYTER/Demo_yourowndata.ipynb)
that can serve as a template for the user to develop a project. Furthermore, we provide a notebook for an already
started project with labeled data. The example project, named as
[Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/tree/main/examples/Reaching-Mackenzie-2018-08-30)
consists of a project configuration file with default parameters and 20 images, which are cropped around the region of
interest as an example dataset. These images are extracted from a video, which was recorded in a study of skilled motor
control in mice. Some example labels for these images are also provided. See more details
[here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/tree/main/examples).

## 3D Toolbox

Please see [3D overview](3D-overview) for information on using the 3D toolbox of
DeepLabCut (as of 2.0.7+).

## Other functions, some are yet-to-be-documented:

We suggest you [check out these additional helper functions](helper-functions), that
could be useful (they are all optional).
