## Abstract

Visual understanding of complex urban street scenes is an enabling factor for a wide range of applications. Object detection has benefited enormously from large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning. For semantic urban scene understanding, however, no current dataset adequately captures the complexity of real-world urban scenes.
To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations; 20000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark.

## Common settings

- All baselines were trained using 8 GPU with a batch size of 8 (1 images per GPU) using the [linear scaling rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677) to scale the learning rate.
- All models were trained on `cityscapes_train`, and tested on `cityscapes_val`.
- 1x training schedule indicates 64 epochs which corresponds to slightly less than the 24k iterations reported in the original schedule from the [Mask R-CNN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)
- COCO pre-trained weights are used to initialize.
- A conversion [script](../../tools/dataset_converters/cityscapes.py) is provided to convert Cityscapes into COCO format. Please refer to [install.md](../../docs/1_exist_data_model.md#prepare-datasets) for details.
- `CityscapesDataset` implemented three evaluation methods. `bbox` and `segm` are standard COCO bbox/mask AP. `cityscapes` is the cityscapes dataset official evaluation, which may be slightly higher than COCO.
